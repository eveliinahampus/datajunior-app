# datajunior-app
Dash application to upload and display data intership/trainee or junior positions. People can upload csv, excel or google sheets via app + I can upload them directly to storage bucket manually, and an automated script will fetch data from my own Google sheet as I update it. ETL process cleans, transforms and uploads data into PostgreSQL database.
